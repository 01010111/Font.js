Font.js adds new Font() functionality to the JavaScript
toolbox, akin to how you use new Image() for images. It
adds an onload event hook so that you don't deploy a
font resource on your webpage before it's actually ready
for use, as browsers can tell you when a font has
downloaded, but not when it has been parsed and made
ready for on-page rendering. This object can.

A demonstrator for this can be found at:
